<p>DAY 0 BASICS OF DATA SCIENCE AND DEEP LEARING , AND SELECTED THIS LEARN-FLOW FOR FUTURE :-
<p>      1- NUMPY BASICS
<p>      2- SCIPY BASICS 
<p>      2- ABOUT MATPLOIT
<p>      3- ABOUT CONVOULUTIONS
<p>      4- KERAS FOR NEURAL NETS
<p>      5- TENSORFLOW BASICS
<p>      6- SCIKIT-LEARN(SKLEARN)
<p>      7- DEEPLEARNIG.AI(COURSERA)
<p>DAY 1 NUMPY BASICS AND DOCUMENTATION (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html)
<p>DAY 2 MATPLOIT BASICS PLOTED GRAPHS OF BASIC FUNCTIONS, AND READ ABOUT SCIPY NDIMAGE PACKAGE, SKLEARN PIPELINE USING LASSO
<p>DAY 3 HYPERPARAMETERS AND TUNING, DIFERENT TYPES OF PREDICTION ALGOS(https://towardsdatascience.com/predictive-modeling-picking-the-best-model-69ad407e1ee7)
<p>DAY 4 LABEL ENCODERS AND TYPES OF ENCODING(INTEGER AND HOT )
<p>DAY 5 TENSORFLOW ENVIROMENT GPU ENVIROMENT IN ANACONDA AND JUPYTER BASICS 
<p>DAY 6 RANDOM FORREST, KNN LINNEAR REGRESSION, DECISON TREE , FROM SCIKIT 
<p>DAY 7 FULLY FOR COURSERA
<p>DAY 8 FULLY FOR COURSERA
<p>DAY 9 FULLY FOR COURSERA
<p>DAY 10 COMPLETED CNN ON COURSERA.
<p>DAY 11 STARTED READING ON IMAGENET PRETRAINED MODELS FOR PROJECT(PROTESET MANAGEMENT)
<p>DAY 12 CHOSE RESNET-50 AND LSTM STRUCTURE FOR STAGE ONE (VIOLENCE DETECION) FOUND A SIMILAR TYPE PROJECT
<p>DAY 13 START READING ABOUT FLASK FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF MODEL IN AN APP TO SUBMIT IN HACKATHON.
<p>DAY 14 AFTER THIS I PRACTICALLY LOST TRACK OF WHAT I DID ON WHAT DAY BUT 
<p>WHAT I TRIED TO DO -:
<p>       GOT INTO DATA SCIENCE 
<p>       ENROLLED IN COURSERA PROGRAM FOR START IN DATA SCIENCE 
<p>       STARTED WITH STATISTICS AND EDA
<p>       AND STILL IN THE PROGRAM FOR IT
<p>       ABOUT THE PROTEST MANAGEMENT PROJECT -:
<p>                   IT GOT SELECTED FOR FINALS IN III GWALIOR HACKATHON
<p>                   TRING TO GET IT FOR LIVE STREAMING 
<p>                   INTEGRATION TO AN APP (FOR THIS STARTED READING FLASK)
<p>                   FLASK DOCUMENTATION
<p>                   USING OF PICKLE
